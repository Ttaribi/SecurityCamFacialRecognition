ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This application captures webcam footage, detects faces, and identifies individuals using a machine learning-powered LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm. It logs both recognized and unknown visitors with timestamps and displays them live on-screen in a sidebar panel.

The project is designed as a lightweight security camera system with basic tracking, database storage, and training functionality â€” all from scratch.


ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Real-time facial detection and recognition via webcam with 85% accuracy

âœ… Automatic logging of recognized and unknown individuals with timestamps  

âœ… Training pipeline that lets users register by capturing face images  

âœ… SQLite database integration** to store student profiles (ID, Name, Age)  

âœ… On-screen countdown before photo capture during training
